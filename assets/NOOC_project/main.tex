\begin{abstract}
Analysis of an urban traffic network has always been a non-trivial task for city planners and engineers due to its high complexity in real life. By utilizing a functional construction method, we interpret traffic data into an abstract graph. Percolation theory applied on the network allow us to analyze the critical phenomenon of urban traffic dynamics. We found that the critical percolation exponent determines the type of the network, which switches between a grid-like topology and a small-world model. The system bottleneck can also be identified by the percolation analysis. With the tools provided in this work, it would be helpful to analyze and to improve urban traffic networks for civil engineers.

abstract = {The transition between free flow and congestions in traffic can be observed in our daily life. Although this traffic phenomenon is well studied in highways, traffic in a network scale (representing a city) is far from being understood. A fundamental unsolved question is how the global flow in a city is being integrated from local flows. Here, we identify a fundamental mechanism of traffic organization in a network scale as a percolation process, and we show how global traffic breaks down when identified bottlenecks are congested. These bottlenecks evolve with time according to traffic dynamics and are different from structural bottleneck links found by traditional network analysis. Improvement of traffic on these bottlenecks can significantly improve the global traffic. A critical phenomenon is an intrinsic feature of traffic dynamics, during which transition between isolated local flows and global flows occurs. However, very little attention has been given to the question of how the local flows in the roads are organized collectively into a global city flow. Here we characterize this organization process of traffic as “traffic percolation,” where the giant cluster of local flows disintegrates when the second largest cluster reaches its maximum. We find in real-time data of city road traffic that global traffic is dynamically composed of clusters of local flows, which are connected by bottleneck links. This organization evolves during a day with different bottleneck links appearing in different hours, but similar in the same hours in different days. A small improvement of critical bottleneck roads is found to benefit significantly the global traffic, providing a method to improve city traffic with low cost. Our results may provide insights on the relation between traffic dynamics and percolation, which can be useful for efficient transportation, epidemic control, and emergency evacuation.}}

abstract = {With the same static road network, it is essentially unknown for urban traffic if traffic flows have the same spatial organization properties for different hours. Based on real-time high-resolution GPS data on the city scale, our results indicate two distinct modes characterized by different percolation critical exponents. The mode during rush hours on working days behaves like a 2D lattice with mainly short-range links, while the mode for other instants behaves like a small world (i.e., a lattice with long-range links). The difference between these two modes is explained here by the free flow on urban highways during nonrush hours, which is like adding long-range links in a 2D lattice. In contrast, during rush hours, such links almost disappear. Percolation transition is widely observed in networks ranging from biology to engineering. While much attention has been paid to network topologies, studies rarely focus on critical percolation phenomena driven by network dynamics. Using extensive real data, we study the critical percolation properties in city traffic dynamics. Our results suggest that two modes of different critical percolation behaviors are switching in the same network topology under different traffic dynamics. One mode of city traffic (during nonrush hours or days off) has similar critical percolation characteristics as small world networks, while the other mode (during rush hours on working days) tends to behave as a 2D lattice. This switching behavior can be understood by the fact that the high-speed urban roads during nonrush hours or days off (that are congested during rush hours) represent effective long-range connections, like in small world networks. Our results might be useful for understanding and improving traffic resilience.}}

      abstract = {Most feedback perimeter control approaches that are based  on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) and are tested  in detailed network structures restrict inflow from the  external boundary of the network. Although such a measure  is beneficial for the network performance, it creates  virtual queues that do not interact with the rest of the  traffic and assumes small unrestricted flow (i.e. almost  zero disturbance). In reality, these queues can have a  negative impact to traffic conditions upstream of the  protected network that is not modelled. In this work an  adaptive optimization scheme for perimeter control of  heterogeneous transportation networks is developed and the  aforementioned boundary control limitation is dropped. A  nonlinear model is introduced that describes the evolution  of the multi-region system over time, assuming the  existence of well-defined MFDs. Multiple linear  approximations of the model (for different set-points) are  used for designing optimal multivariable integral feedback  regulators. Since the resulting regulators are derived from  approximations of the nonlinear dynamics, they are further  enhanced in real-time with online learning/adaptive  optimization, according to performance measurements. An  iterative data-driven technique is integrated with the  model-based design and its objective is to optimize the  gain matrices and set-points of the multivariable perimeter  controller based on real-time observations. The efficiency  of the derived multi-boundary control scheme is tested in  microsimulation for a large urban network with more than  1500 roads that is partitioned in multiple regions. The  proposed control scheme is demonstrated to achieve a better  distribution of congestion (by creating "artificial"  inter-regional queues), thus preventing the network  degradation and improving total delay and outflow.

\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated a series of tools for traffic network analysis. The metrics presented in the previous sections indicate different characteristics of a traffic network. The critical threshold $q_c$ indicates the robustness of a network; the critical percolation exponent $\tau$ roughly captures the type of a network, and the connectivity of distant points.

Meanwhile, based on the finding of the impact of bottleneck, we have a deeper understanding for congestion formation and dissipation mechanisms. In the future, the control of bottleneck traffic can have a significant effect for mitigating the city traffic congestion.

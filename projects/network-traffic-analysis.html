                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Analysis of an urban traffic network has always been a non-trivial task for city planners and engineers due to its high complexity in real life. By utilizing a functional construction method, we interpret traffic data into an abstract graph. Percolation theory applied on the network allow us to analyze the critical phenomenon of urban traffic dynamics. We found that the critical percolation exponent determines the type of the network, which switches between a grid-like topology and a small-world model. The system bottleneck can also be identified by the percolation analysis. With the tools provided in this work, it would be helpful to analyze and to improve urban traffic networks for civil engineers.</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>The urban traffic network is one of the most nature but complex network arises in our daily life, while graph theory has successfully developed plenty of results on characterizing various types of networks. With the help of the theoretical results, it's now possible to analyze the macroscopic characteristics of urban traffic network.</p>
                
                <p>To analyze the organization and the quality of an urban traffic network, we consider that "how much a network suffers from congestion?" That is, how drivers can travel to their destination in the network within reasonable time, and free from any congestion? Since urban traffic network can be regarded as a 2D grid percolation process, we utilize the concept of network percolation to investigate the functionality of a traffic network. As the traffic demand rises within the network, some of the roads may become congested and thus become a dysfunctional link in the network. Thus, a network has good quality if it's mostly connected by a giant component via non-congested roads. Conversely, the network has a bad quality if the congested roads disconnect too many sections, resulting multiple small connected components.</p>
                
                <p>We can also analyze the dynamics of the network by comparing the evolution of congestion condition along different time. Thus, we can identify normal hours and rush hours along with their level of congestion, which should be beneficial information for city planners and civil engineers.</p>

                <h2>2. Methods</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 Functional Traffic Network Construction</h3>
                <p>In order to analyze the percolation transition in dynamic traffic network, a framework is built based on percolation theory. Instead of constructing a network based on the structure topology, only roads in the network with a speed greater than a specified threshold are considered functionally linked in this framework.</p>
                
                <p>Roads in real-world traffic networks can be divided into distinct states based on their speed. A road is considered as functional only if its velocity level meets a given demand. A variable threshold q ∈ [0, 1] is set to denote the speed demand of drivers at a given time. Measured data of speed is sorted during a long period of time for each road segment in increasing order, the 95 percentile is chosen as the standard maximal value of this road. Then the speed of each road from site i to site j at time is normalized to get the relative speed. Since the road network is a directed graph, the speed is usually different based on the direction of the traffic flow.</p>
                
                <h3>2.2 Critical Threshold q<sub>c</sub></h3>
                <p>We construct a functional network of the traffic dynamics from the original topology for any given q. If q=0, every road section meets demand, and the functioning traffic network is identical to the previous network. On the other hand, if q=1, since almost all the links are removed from the original network, the functional network becomes completely fragmented. The functional traffic network becomes diluted as q grows from 0 to 1, which is known as "traffic percolation". q<sub>c</sub>(t) is the crucial threshold value of q in traffic percolation, where the huge component of the dynamical network breaks down into fragmented local traffic clusters and the second biggest cluster reaches its maximum size.</p>
                
                <h3>2.3 Reachable Areas Analysis</h3>
                <p>To verify the fidelity of our network model, we analyze the reachable areas from specific starting points during different time periods. This helps visualize how congestion affects connectivity in the network.</p>

                <h3>3.1 Analysis of Network Percolation with Different q Values</h3>
                <p>Based on the network constructing method illustrated in the previous part, a functional traffic network which related to the choice of q is built. To understand the relationship between q and the efficiency of the road network, we modify the value of q and investigate the construction process of the dynamical traffic network to observe the emergence of global city traffic in the network scale at a particular moment.</p>
                
                <p>We choose a moment when the road network is congested and analyze three different q values. At first, for q=0.69, only small clusters of connected high-speed roadways show up, which is unable to support global network traffic. As the value of q decreases to 0.07, these small clusters combine together and a giant cluster appears, where the functional network (with lower velocity) extends to almost the full scale of original road network. According to percolation theory, the size of the second-largest cluster becomes greatest at q=0.09, indicating the phase transition point for network connection of a functioning traffic network.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Critical Threshold Analysis</h3>
                <p>To understand the percolation-like process better, we analyze the relationship between q and the size of largest and second largest component. The size of the giant component diminishes as q grows, and the second-largest cluster achieves a maximum at the critical threshold (q<sub>c</sub>), which separates the fragmented and linked phases of the traffic network.</p>

                <h3>3.4 Critical Percolation Exponent</h3>
                <p>We test the critical percolation exponent τ based on our network construction model. As suggested in previous research, we select q=q<sub>c</sub> as the threshold and count the connected components from the inferred graph. First, we demonstrate an example to show the exponential relationship between n<sub>s</sub> and s, where n<sub>s</sub> is the number of clusters of size s.</p>
                
                <div class="image-section">
                    <img src="../assets/NOOC_project/images/linear_fit.png" alt="Percolation Cluster Power Law" class="project-image">

                </div>
                
                <p>We calculate the evolution of τ as time progresses. Although the τ value should theoretically range between 2.05 and 2.5 according to percolation theory, we observe that many data points deviate from these theoretical values. This is likely because our network size is not large enough, and the network is not exactly grid-like. Additionally, the theoretical results are derived from undirected graphs, while our road hierarchy involves multiple one-way paths.</p>
                
                <p>To verify this claim, we construct another network assuming all roads are two-way roads. We can see the value is more centered around 2.05 to 2.5 in the undirected network than in the directed one. Nevertheless, we can still observe the trend that with higher τ values, the connectivity of the network is better by examining its relationship with q<sub>c</sub>. Since τ is positively related to q<sub>c</sub>, higher values indicate a more resilient network towards heavy traffic.</p>

                <h3>3.5 Bottleneck Analysis</h3>
                <p>Based on previous research, the network at percolation criticality acts as the original network's "backbone." There are specific links that have a significant effect for bridging different functional clusters of traffic. These links can be considered as bottlenecks, whose speed are the lowest among the links in the backbone.</p>
                
                <p>Since road network is a directed graph, we define the component as strongly connected component, in which all pairs of nodes are mutually accessible from each other along a directed path. Therefore, if the bottleneck is removed, the giant component will disintegrate into different clusters.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>Besides, the bottleneck link could also have an impact on the global traffic. If the speed of bottleneck is increased (r<sub>ij</sub>' = r<sub>ij</sub>(1+α)), then q<sub>c</sub> of the traffic network is significantly increased. However, if we increase the link speed randomly, there is no such effect for the global network.</p>

                <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
                <p>We have demonstrated a series of tools for traffic network analysis. The metrics presented in the previous sections indicate different characteristics of a traffic network. The critical threshold q<sub>c</sub> indicates the robustness of a network; the critical percolation exponent τ roughly captures the type of a network, and the connectivity of distant points.</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, based on the finding of the impact of bottleneck, we have a deeper understanding for congestion formation and dissipation mechanisms. In the future, the control of bottleneck traffic can have a significant effect for mitigating the city traffic congestion.</p>
